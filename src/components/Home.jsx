            I&apos;m Nikola Šepić, a passionate software engineer based in
            Belgrade, Serbia, holding a Bachelor&apos;s degree in Information
            Technology. <br /> I&apos;m eager to make my mark in the tech
            industry, with a keen interest in web development, especially in
            front-end technologies like React. My dedication to writing
            efficient, well structured code drives my continual learning and
            growth in this ever-evolving field.
            <br /> I believe in the value of collaboration, attention to detail,
            and a proactive approach to problem solving qualities that are
            highly regarded in the industry.
            <br /> Beyond coding, I love diving into a good book, spending
            quality time with my cat, taking relaxing walks, or staying
            energized through workouts at the gym.

                  MoveFit is a dynamic web application designed to help users
                  discover and learn about various exercises tailored to
                  specific muscle groups. The project leverages data from an API
                  to provide detailed information and visual guidance on a wide
                  range of workouts.
                  <br /> Users can easily filter exercises by selecting a target
                  muscle group, and each exercise has its own dedicated page
                  featuring comprehensive details. These include instructional
                  videos, descriptions on proper form, and GIFs that visually
                  demonstrate the exercise motion, ensuring clarity and ease of
                  understanding. MoveFit also highlights which muscle groups are
                  engaged and lists the necessary equipment for each workout.
                  <br />
                  Built with React, the application utilizes technologies such
                  as React Router for seamless navigation and Material Icons to
                  enhance the user interface, delivering an intuitive and
                  visually appealing experience.

                  Wild Oasis is a comprehensive web application built for
                  employees of a company that manages rental properties, such as
                  vacation cabins or houses. The platform provides a robust
                  dashboard that displays essential metrics, including the total
                  number of reservations, sales and the current status of rented
                  properties.
                  <br /> Access to the site is secured with protected routes,
                  ensuring that only authorized staff members can view and

                  and manage user profiles for clients who have made
                  reservations. Additionally, new staff members can be added to
                  the system through the interface.
                  <br /> The project is developed using React, with CSS modules
                  for styling to maintain a clean and modular design. The
                  integration of Supabase ensures efficient and real-time data
